## Main rules of collaborating

1. In out team each member has separate branch on which they make changes
2. The head branch is `main`, so the only way to push your code is via pull request
3. At the end we create a pull request to branch `main` and merge separate branch

Using this way of development and collaborating we solve main branch coruption issue

The up-to-date version of the application is always in the branch `main`.

### Uploading changes

Steps of uploading changes to the main branch on repository:

1. Adding changes on your brunch
2. Checking if everything works and creating `commit` with massage of the changes
3. Check if everything added properly using `git status` command in terminal
4. If everything is ready `push` your changes into your brunch on the repository
5. On GitHub responsible person checks if the changes are proper and merge them with the `main` branch
